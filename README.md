# Inks Multi Tool
The goal of this project is to make neopets automation available to everyone and anyone without any limitations. Still to this day I see paywalls on forums where you need to pay to access specific programs and/or scripts. That's where Inks Multi Tool comes into play - giving you access to the safest automation tools available for <b>free</b>.<br><br>
Inks Multi Tool uses multi-threading to allow you to run as many accounts concurrently as you would like. Because of this, proxy support has also been included to keep you as safe as humanly possible. Each task that Inks Multi Tool automates for you is first done manually by a human to find out the safest (randomized) delays between each action. If you can't clear a stage of Ghoul Catchers within less than a second, then why should a program be able to do that. It doesn't make sense, does it?
